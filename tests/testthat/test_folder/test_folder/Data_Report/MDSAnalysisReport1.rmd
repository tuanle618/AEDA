## Multidimensional Scaling Summary Report
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a **visual representation of distances or dissimilarities
between sets of objects**. Objects can be colors, faces, map coordinates, political persuasion, or any kind
of real conceptual stimuli

Objects that are more similar (or have shorter distances) are closer together on the graph than objects that
are less similar (or have linger distances). As well as interpreting dissilarities as distances on a graph, MDS
can also serve as a dimension reduction technique for high-dimensional data.
An MDS algorithm aims to place each object in $K-$dimensional space such that the between-object distances are
preserved as well as possible. The approach of AEDA is to set $K = 2$ in order to create a two-dimensional
scatterplot to represent the objects.
```{r loadMDSObj_zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
if (!require("DT",character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("DT",dep=TRUE)
    if(!require("DT",character.only = TRUE)) stop("Package not found")
    }
zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh = readRDS("zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh.rds")
```
### Multidimensional Scaling Summary Results

The following data frame shows the created dimensions for numeric columns from the dataset:
```{r showMDSdf_zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
dt = DT::datatable(zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh$mds.analysis$mds.result.data, class = 'compact', filter = 'bottom', options = list(pageLength = 10),
      caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
      style = 'caption-side: bottom; text-align: center;',
      'Table : ', 'Multidimensional Scaling Result'
      ))
dt
```

### Multidimensional Scaling Plot

In the following the result of MDS will be shown:
```{r showMDSPlot_zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
zYoQ12yG8nWA4tZh$mds.analysis$mds.plot
```
